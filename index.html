                    Hi, my name is Antoine Lavenseau. I am currently a french student in first year of engineering
                    school,
                    specialized in computer science. I am looking for an internship abroad, in full stack
                    development.<br>
                    I created this website from scratch, using only HTML, CSS and Javascript, and no frameworks, to
                    present myself in detail.
                    You will learn a lot about me, like my different hobbies, or some projects I worked on, have fun
                    visiting my website!

                                    I have been doing handball for 4 years, I did 3 years in high school, and I resumed
                                    this year 2023. This sport taught me to play as a team, and to take up challenges.
                                    Indeed, by resuming handball this year, I was able to play again with my friends
                                    from high school, who had also stopped. We had to relearn how to play, while playing
                                    in a league far superior to ours. We had a lot of losses, but we still fought all
                                    year, until winning, against teams that were twice our level at the start of the
                                    year. I play at right-back, which requires high jumps and full-power shots from long
                                    range. (In this photo, I am to the right of the person in the red jersey, my
                                    goalkeeper).

                                        In April 2023, I took up a challenge with some friends to do 1 month of intense
                                        climbing. The challenge was to climb 4 times a week, as well as strength
                                        training to
                                        improve progression.
                                        This challenge taught me to stay consistent, not to lose hope in the face of
                                        difficulty and to push my limits. Indeed, the first few weeks my body was
                                        exhausted.
                                        I could see a clear improvement in only 1 month. At the end of the month, I
                                        managed
                                        many red runs, and I even managed my first black run!

                            During my first internship in 2022-2023 at Brumisphere, I was able to work on different
                            websites, mainly on the front-end. I worked on wordpress, using a simple and manageable
                            template. I made the basic structure in html, then I came to work in css and javascript to
                            get
                            the
                            expected result.
                            This project is a website for Savan, an application that allows you to find service
                            providers to work on vans or motorhomes.

                            Bordeaux Open Air is a festival that takes place in Bordeaux every summer since 2016. I had
                            the
                            opportunity to work on several different pages of this website, again on wordpress. I was
                            also
                            able to work on the different artists and events pages. For this I was able to work in PHP,
                            in
                            order to create template pages, and to retrieve specific information about the
                            artists/events,
                            and to create all the pages more easily.

                            Giant Sentinel is a project I worked on during my internship at Programisto in early 2023. I
                            was
                            able to work in html, css and javascript, without a framework. My mission was to create a
                            google
                            chrome extension, which allows to analyse emails, in order to detect if they were phishing
                            attempts or not, and to inform the user. I was able to work on the creation of the extension
                            (login pop-up), as well as on the injection of content in Gmail. This project allowed me to
                            progress a lot in Javascript, in connection portal management, and in API use.
